# State/Union territory-level population

These files contain data manually entered from the Indian population projections report published in 2019 (see `reports/population_projections_2019.pdf`).

`india_pop_july_table11.csv` are population projections as of July 1 for each year, abstracted from Table 11. These projections serve as the basis for state-level analyses.

`india_pop_march_table8.csv` are population projections as of March 1 for each year, abstracted from Table 8. Earlier versions of the paper were based on these data.
